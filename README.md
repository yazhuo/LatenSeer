# LatenSeer
The repo for SoCC23 Paper: LatenSeer: Causal Modeling of End-to-End Latency Distributions by Harnessing Distributed Tracing.

## What is LatenSeer
LatenSeer is a modeling framework for estimating end-to-end latency distributions in microservice-based web applications.
- An offline tool.
- Harnesses distributed tracing.
- Enables what-if analysis, predicting the potential impacts on end-to-end latency distribution due to various changes in service latencies.
