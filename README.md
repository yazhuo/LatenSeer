## What is LatenSeer
LatenSeer is a modeling framework for estimating end-to-end latency distributions in microservice-based web applications.
- An offline tool.
- Harnesses distributed tracing.
- Enables what-if analysis, predicting the potential impacts on end-to-end latency distribution due to various changes in service latencies.

## Repo Structure
The repo includes the [source code](src/) of LatenSeer, [scripts](scripts/) for setting up DSB experiments, and a [script](src/fetch_dsb_traces.py) for collecting DSB Jaeger traces.

### How to use LatenSeer

First, you can create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install LatenSeer:
```bash
pip install .
```

Now you are good to do a test run. We provide a [simple tutorial](examples/simple_tutorial.ipynb) about how to use LatenSeer.
